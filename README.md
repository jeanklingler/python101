# Python101

Training material to understand python type system and concepts.
Based on jupyter notebooks.

## Getting started

### Requirements

You will need a version of python >=3.6, and best to use a virtualenv.

Example to get a working venv:
```bash
cd <this repo>
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, you need to install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the project

```bash
# run the first part:
$ jupyter notebook Python101-part1.ipynb
# later, run the next part:
$ jupyter notebook Python101-part2.ipynb
```

This will open Jupyter in your browser.
